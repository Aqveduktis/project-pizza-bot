# Pizza Bot

We made a bot who you can order pizza from. 

## The problem
The plan was already made, but we tested the functionality of each function and then formulated the functions. Then we replaced the alerts with innerHtml. The last thing was replacing prompt with input. 
We used if/else a lot.

The next thing would be not to have text-boxes but bullets to choose which pizza and a numberbox or maybe limit to 10 pizzas. that would remove the need for confirming which indata you get.
